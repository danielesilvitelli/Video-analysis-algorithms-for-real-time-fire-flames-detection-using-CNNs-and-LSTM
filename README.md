# üî• Video analysis algorithms for real-time fire flames detection using CNNs and LSTM
Fire detection is a critical component of modern safety systems, and early detection can save lives and prevent significant property damage. This research focuses on developing advanced video analysis algorithms that use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) to detect fire flames in real time. By combining the power of deep learning with video surveillance, the system can identify fire outbreaks instantly, enabling quicker responses and reducing the risk of catastrophic outcomes. This work is crucial not only for enhancing public safety but also for advancing the field of AI-powered image and video processing, with applications spanning from fire prevention systems to disaster management. üéØ

## üåü Key Features
- **Real-time detection**
- ***The system is designed to analyze video streams in real-time, enabling immediate identification of fire flames. This is critical for fast emergency responses, especially in environments where rapid action is required (e.g., buildings, factories, forests).***
- **Integration of CNNs and LSTM**
CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks): Used for spatial feature extraction to detect visual patterns of fire flames, such as flickering, color variations, and movement.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory network): Incorporates temporal analysis, allowing the system to track the continuity of the fire across frames and recognize its evolution over time, which is essential for distinguishing fire from other visual disturbances.
- **Secure**: Your data is encrypted with the highest security standards.
